# FutureProof-USA-Jobs

**FutureProof-USA-Jobs** is a practical framework to protect American workers in the AI era.  
Its mission: **Save jobs, upgrade skills, and rebuild roles instead of layoffs.**

This project is not about creating idols or slogans — it is about **real capability and proven design**.  
Patents carry my name, but the repo stands as evidence of solid work and practical solutions.
