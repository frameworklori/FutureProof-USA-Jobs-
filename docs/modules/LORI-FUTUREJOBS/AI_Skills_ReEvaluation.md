# AI Skills Re-Evaluation Module

## Purpose
The AI Skills Re-Evaluation module is designed to **reassess, test, and integrate a worker’s skills, personality traits, and adaptive potential** in the AI era.
Its output is a set of **personalized career development directions** and **training roadmaps** that HR departments can use to guide education and workforce planning.

## System Architecture

1. **Input Layer**
- **Skills Assessment**: Task-based challenges, simulations, or knowledge quizzes to measure technical and soft skills.
- **Personality & Trait Evaluation**: Behavior-based questionnaires, communication analysis, leadership potential tests.
- **Learning Agility Index**: Measures adaptability, speed of knowledge uptake, and resilience under change.

2. **Integration Layer**
- **Capability Mapping Engine**: Aligns current skillsets with industry-standard competency frameworks.
- **Trait-Skill Fusion Model**: Combines personality traits with technical strengths to highlight natural fits.
- **AI Demand Matcher**: Cross-references worker profiles with emerging labor market data.

3. **Output Layer**
- **Career Path Suggestions**: Three-tier recommendations:
- *Short-term*: direct role upgrades with minimal training.
- *Mid-term*: transition roles requiring structured retraining.
- *Long-term*: future-proof tracks aligned with AI-driven industries.
- **Skill Gap Report**: Identifies missing capabilities and recommends specific courses.
- **HR Integration Package**: Exportable data (CSV/JSON/API) for HR systems.

## Example Flow

1. Worker inputs prior job experience (e.g., factory technician).
2. AI tests mechanical knowledge, digital tool usage, and teamwork style.
3. Capability map shows strengths in **machine operations + safety compliance**.
4. AI recommends:
- Short-term: **Factory AI Maintenance Assistant**
- Mid-term: **Industrial IoT Safety Specialist**
- Long-term: **Green Energy Equipment Supervisor**
5. HR receives a tailored training package to bridge gaps.

## Strategic Benefits

- **For Workers**: Provides clarity, confidence, and realistic pathways instead of “start from zero.”
- **For Companies**: Reduces training costs and mis-hires by aligning development with real needs.
- **For Society**: Builds a **dynamic employment firewall** against AI-driven disruption.

## Relation to LORI Future Proof – USA – Jobs

This module is one of the **pillars** of the Future Proof Jobs framework, feeding directly into:
- [`Capability_Map.md`](Capability_Map.md): visualization of skills-personality-job matches.
- [`HR_Training_Database.md`](HR_Training_Database.md): centralized repository for HR departments to track, assign, and evaluate training.
