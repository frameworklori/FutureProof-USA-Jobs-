# USA Jobs Framework

## Purpose
This document outlines the **Future Proof – USA – Jobs** framework, integrating AI-driven evaluation, capability mapping, HR training databases, and resilience indices.

## Core Principles
- **Upgrade, not replace** → Skills are layered, not discarded.  
- **Value Recycling** → Existing experience is repurposed into new contexts.  
- **Public–Private Collaboration** → Companies, government, and schools co-invest in training.  
- **Employment Firewall** → Build resilience against AI-driven disruption.

## Modules
- [AI Skills Re-Evaluation](AI_Skills_ReEvaluation.md)  
- [Capability Map](Capability_Map.md)  
- [HR Training Database](HR_Training_Database.md)  
- [Resilience Index](ResilienceIndex.md)  
- [Skill Upgrade Pipeline](SkillUpgrade_Pipeline.md)  

## Expected Outcomes
- Clearer career paths for workers.  
- Reduced unemployment shocks.  
- Stronger alignment between HR and market demands.
