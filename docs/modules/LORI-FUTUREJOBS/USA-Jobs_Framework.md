## 🌐 Overview
The **Future Proof – USA – Jobs** framework is designed to protect and transform the U.S. workforce in the AI era.
Its guiding principle is simple:

> **“Jobs may disappear, but people’s skills do not. By layering and upgrading existing skills, displaced workers can generate new, reusable value.”**

---

## 🔑 Core Principles
1. **Upgrade, Not Replace** – Workers remain relevant by building upon existing skills.
2. **Value Recycling** – Past experience is repurposed into future job contexts.
3. **Public–Private Collaboration** – Companies, governments, and schools co-invest in reskilling.
4. **Employment Firewall** – A safeguard against AI-driven disruption.
